# Getting Started
## Frontend
### Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```
or 

```bash
npm start
```
Both essentially do the same thing. 

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

>For more information regarding setup, look at the Frontend Readme file.
