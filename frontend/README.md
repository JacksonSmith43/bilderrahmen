## Warning:
At one point, when trying to solve the CORS issue an error

After some troubleshooting only switching strictTemplates to false made the error go away. Copilot things that it might be an Angular Version issue. 


## Built with: 
- Angular.
- HTML.
- CSS.
- Bootstrap.
- Probably something else as well. 
  
# Getting Started
## Prerequisite
Certain software has to be installed before starting: 
- [Node.js und npm](https://nodejs.org/) 
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli): `npm install -g @angular/cli`


## Things to install
### npm
To install node_modules (which is required because it gives you the libraries (project dependencies)):
```bash
npm install
```

### Firebase Configurations
##### CORS Explanation
Simple explanation:
In order to avoid the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Problem gcloud-CLI has to be installed. The CORS-Problem is the Browser essentially being overprotective and requires to know where a resource is coming from.

More precise:
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers that restricts web applications from making requests to a domain different from the one that served the web application. When your application hosted on one domain (e.g., localhost:4200) tries to access resources from another domain (like Firebase Storage), the browser blocks these requests by default.
To allow these cross-origin requests, we need to configure the Firebase Storage bucket to explicitly permit requests from our application's domain. This is done by setting CORS policies using the gcloud CLI tool.

#### gcloud-CLI

Install gcloud-CLI (Google Cloud):
```bash
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe", "$env:Temp\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe")

& $env:Temp\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe
```
Configuration: Set the CORS-Settings for the Firebase Storage Bucket: 
```bash
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://<Storage_Bucket_Name>
``` 
For example: 
```bash
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://bilderrahmen-33e52.firebasestorage.app
```

Incase there is an authentication error, try:
```bash
gcloud auth login
```

#### Firebase
Install Firebase tools globally:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Login:
```bash
firebase login
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```
or 

```bash
npm start
```
Both essentially do the same thing. 

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
